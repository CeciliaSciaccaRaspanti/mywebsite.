                    <p>Hi, and welcome to my website!<br> I’m Cecilia, a digital analyst student based in Helsingborg and Malmö. I started building this website from scratch using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose was to optimize my learning by actually doing it. This website has become my little space on the internet where I practice, try out different tools, and use it as a way to test the skills I’m developing during my education to become a digital analyst. Feel free to explore my website, share your insights, and connect with me. I hope you enjoy your visit!</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <section>
                <h4 class="sectionProfessional">Professional Background</h4>
                <p>My journey to becoming a digital analyst started with my love for creating online content. From a young age, I enjoyed analyzing things, which led me to experiment with different types of content and share them on various platforms. This experience sparked my interest in marketing and curiosity about how things work behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>After a three-year education to become an assistant nurse with a focus on psychology and over nine years working in healthcare, I developed valuable interpersonal skills and gained deep insights into human behavior. I have not only developed strong people skills but also learned how to meet new people, guide and educate both newcomers and interns, and assist with their integration into the team and during their internship.

During these nine years, I also worked as a coordinator within healthcare, which is how I gained my organizational and planning skills by managing schedules and personnel. This experience has helped me structure my work, develop problem-solving abilities, and identify and address needs effectively.</p>
                <p>Driven by my passion for content creation and a growing interest in marketing and data, I discovered digital analytics. After many years within the same industry, I finally felt that I had more to give, which led me to pursue my dream by enrolling in the Digital Analytics Specialist program at IHM Business School in Malmö in 2023.</p>
